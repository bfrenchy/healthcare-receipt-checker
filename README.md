# Healthcare Receipt Checker

This app creates synthetic UCLA Health (sorry UCLA...) visit receipts, currently n=1500.

Once done, duplicate_finder.py parses through each pdf file, extracts the text, and stores the duplicates in a local .csv "database".

The Jupyter Notebook has some highlights about the dataset and the output of the functions.
